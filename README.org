Lambda-line is a custom status-line for Emacs. It is configurable for use either
as a header-line or as a footer-line (i.e. what is called the "mode-line" for
Emacs).

The status-line has the structure:

[ status name (primary) tertiary secondary ]

Information displayed depends on major mode. Not all segments display in every mode.

* Installation

This package is not yet on MELPA. In the meantime to use this package you'll
have to clone or otherwise download the repo and put it into your load path.
Here's a basic way of setting it up using [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] and [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][straight]].

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package lambda-line
    :straight (:type git :host github :repo "lambda-emacs/lambda-line") 
    :custom
    ;; Set position of status-line 
    (lambda-line-position 'top)
    :config
    (lambda-line-mode))
#+end_src

* Options

Lambda-line has a lot of different options for customization. Please see
=M-x customize-group lambda-line= for full details.

- Set =lambda-line-position= to header (top) or footer (bottom).
- Use a prefix status icon in the status-line with =lambda-line-prefix t=.
- Customize the various prefix status symbols in both GUI and TTY with
  =lambda-line-GUI/TTY-RO/RW/MD-symbol=.
   + *NOTE*: If you use symbols you should make sure you are using a font that
        will display them properly. Here is one reliable way, using [[https://fontlibrary.org/en/font/symbola][Symbola]] font:
        #+begin_src emacs-lisp
          (use-package fontset
            :straight (:type built-in) ;; only include this if you use straight
            :config
            ;; Use symbola for proper unicode
            (when (member "Symbola" (font-family-list))
              (set-fontset-font
               t 'symbol "Symbola" nil)))
        #+end_src
- Abbreviate major modes with =lambda-line-abbrev=.
- Show both vc project and branch in the modeline
- Show the diff in the status-line with =lambda-line-git-diff-mode-line=.
- Set the symbol for vc project buffers with =lambda-line-vc-symbol=.
- Set a visual bell with =lambda-line-visual-bell=.
- Set char length for truncating information using =lambda-line-truncate-value=. 
- Control the right margin padding with =lambda-line-hspace=. 
- Set the top and bottom padding of the status-line with =lambda-line-space-top=.
  and =lambda-line-space-bottom=.
- Set the position of the prefix status symbol with =lambda-line-symbol-position=.
- Show flycheck/flymake report in status-line with =lambda-line-syntax=.
- Set the modes in which the status-line is formatted with
  =lambda-line-mode-formats=. 
- Set the default display function for the status-line with
  =lambda-line-default-mode-format=. This is set to =lambda-line-default-mode= but
  can be customized to any function the user wishes.

  
Lambda-line also sets a variety of faces that can be individually customized.
