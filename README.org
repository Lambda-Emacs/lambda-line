Lambda-line is a custom status-line for Emacs. It is configurable for use either
as a header-line or as a footer-line (i.e. what is called the "mode-line" for
Emacs).

The status-line has the structure:

[ status name (primary) tertiary secondary ]

Information displayed depends on major mode. Not all segments display in every mode.
